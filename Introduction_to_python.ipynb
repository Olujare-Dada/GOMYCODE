    "## Types of Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Procedural Languages:** These languages are based on a procedural or step-by-step approach to solving problems. They focus on writing procedures or routines that define the sequence of steps to be executed.Examples include C, Pascal, and Fortran.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Functional Languages:** Functional languages treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. They emphasize immutability and avoid changing state or mutable data. Example: Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scripting Languages:** Scripting languages are often used for automating tasks or writing small programs. They have concise syntax and are typically interpreted rather than compiled. Examples: Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Markup Languages:** Markup languages are used to define the structure and presentation of documents. They use tags to mark elements within the document. Examples include HTML for web pages and XML for data representation.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Declarative Languages:** Declarative languages express the desired result without specifying the step-by-step procedure to achieve it. SQL is an example of a declarative language used for database queries.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Low-level Languages:** Low-level languages are closer to the hardware and provide more direct control over the computer's resources. Examples include Assembly language and Machine code.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Languages:** In object-oriented languages, data and functions are organized into objects, which encapsulate data and behavior together. Examples: Python, Java, C#\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs):** DSLs are designed for specific domains or problem areas. They are tailored to address particular tasks efficiently. Examples include SQL for database querying and HTML/CSS for web development.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Concurrent and Parallel Languages:** These languages are designed to handle concurrent and parallel programming, allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. Examples include Go and Erlang."

    "### Runtime Vs Compile Time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime and compile time are two distinct phases in the execution of a computer program. They represent different stages in the life cycle of a program, and understanding their differences is crucial for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compile Time:\n",
    "Compile time refers to the phase of program execution when the source code is converted into machine code or bytecode by a compiler.\n",
    "In compiled languages like C, C++, and Java, the code is first written by the programmer in a human-readable form (source code). The compiler then translates this source code into a lower-level representation that the computer can understand (machine code or bytecode).\n",
    "During the compilation process, the compiler performs various tasks such as syntax checking, type checking, and generating intermediate code.\n",
    "Any errors or issues in the code, such as syntax errors or type mismatches, are detected by the compiler at this stage, and the program cannot proceed to the next phase (runtime) until these issues are resolved.\n",
    "Once the code is successfully compiled, an executable file or bytecode is generated, which can be executed at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime:\n",
    "Runtime refers to the phase of program execution when the compiled code is run and executed by the computer's processor.\n",
    "During runtime, the compiled code is loaded into memory, and the processor executes the instructions one by one.\n",
    "At this stage, the program interacts with the system resources, such as memory, files, and network, to perform its tasks.\n",
    "If the program encounters any runtime errors, such as division by zero or out-of-bounds array access, it may terminate unexpectedly or produce incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Difference:\n",
    "Compile time is the phase when the source code is translated into machine code or bytecode and checked for syntax and type errors. It happens before the program is executed.\n",
    "Runtime is the phase when the compiled code is executed by the computer's processor and interacts with system resources. It happens during the actual execution of the program."

    "## Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing is a programming language feature where the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than being explicitly defined at compile-time. In dynamically typed languages, variables can hold values of any type, and their type can be changed during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly specify the type of a variable when you declare it. You can assign any value to a variable, and Python will automatically determine its type based on the value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> x = 10      $\\to$ x is an integer<br>\n",
    "> x = \"hello\" $\\to$ x is now a string<br>\n",
    "> x = [1, 2, 3] $\\to$ x is now a list\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the variable x is dynamically typed. It starts as an integer, then it becomes a string, and finally, it becomes a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed because it follows the philosophy of being a simple and expressive language. By allowing dynamic typing, Python provides flexibility and ease of use. Developers can focus on solving problems and writing code without worrying about explicit type declarations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing also promotes faster development and prototyping since you can quickly change the behavior of variables without the need for recompiling or declaring types. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's dynamic typing allows for flexibility but comes at the cost of additional type checks during runtime. This can slow down the execution of certain operations.\n"

    "\n",
    "https://realpython.com/python-variables/#:~:text=A%20Python%20variable%20is%20a,still%20contained%20within%20the%20object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variable assignment is the process of associating a name (the variable) with a value. When you assign a value to a variable, you are creating a reference to that value, allowing you to use the value later in your code using the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for variable assignment in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **variable_name = value**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules of Variable Assigment**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 1. Valid Variable Names: Variable names can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_). However, they must start with a letter or an underscore. Python is case-sensitive, so variables named \"my_var\" and \"My_Var\" are considered different.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Numbers must never come first\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No Reserved Keywords: You cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., if, else, while, for, etc.) as variable names since they have special meanings in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. No Spaces or Special Characters: Variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters (e.g., !, @, #, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Avoid Using Built-in Names: It is best to avoid using names that are already used as built-in functions or predefined names in Python (e.g., print, str, int, etc.), as this may lead to unintended behavior or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Meaningful Names: Use meaningful and descriptive names for your variables to make your code more readable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Snake Case: The convention in Python is to use snake_case for variable names, where words are separated by underscores (e.g., my_variable_name)."
